# LitDocs

These are utilities to create documentation for LitElement related projects. It
is created in LitElement itself, and therefore it is easy to demonstrate your
library, custom components, or anything you made to use together with
LitElement or Web Components in general.

The utilities are documented in the
[docs](https://gitaarik.github.io/lit-docs/demo-app/build/), which itself is
created with LitDocs.
